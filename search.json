    "text": "3.1 Types of Interactions\nThere are two types of interaction effects: cross-over interactions and fan-shaped interactions. Graphically, both types of interaction effects can be identified by the appearance of non-parallel lines. However, the way these lines diverge from one another are what define whether it is a cross-over or fan-shaped interaction.\n\n3.1.1 Cross-Over Interaction\nA cross-over interaction occurs when individuals at different levels of M start at different points on Y, and when interacting with X the effects on Y go in different directions; when looking at a graph of the effects, you can see the lines “cross-over.” A visual representation of this kind of interaction can be displayed in a line graph with two groups:\n\n\n\nCross-over Interaction\n\n\nWhere the predictor/independent variable X is on the x-axis, the outcome/dependent variable Y is on the y-axis, and the different levels/groups of the moderator variable M are represented by the different colored lines in the graph (i.e., the z-axis). An interaction can be identified visually by non-parallel lines at different levels of the moderator.\n\n\n3.1.2 Fan-Shaped Interaction\nFan-shaped interactions occur when individuals at different levels of M either start or end near each other on Y, but appear to diverge at different levels of X. For example: there may be an interaction between the presence of Alzheimer’s disease and time when trying to predict an individual’s verbal memory. Imagine a task where a list of words is repeatedly read to an individual. After completing the task, they are asked to recall as many of those words as possible at various periods of time (e.g., at 5-minute intervals). At first, early on in the assessment (i.e., after the first 5 minutes) the number of words recalled by individuals in both groups (i.e., at different levels of M) may not significantly differ from one another; individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease appear to recall the same amount of words. However, as more time passes, the interaction effect between time and the presence of the disease becomes more apparent. That is, at later time points (i.e., after 20 minutes) the gap between the amount of words recalled by both groups become significantly different. In this case, we can say that the presence of Alzheimer’s disease interacts with the passing of time to cause a faster decline in the number of words recalled. In other words, the number of words recalled over time differs between individuals who have Alzheimer’s versus individuals who do not.\nVisually, this can be displayed in a line graph with two groups:\n\n\n\nFan-Shaped Interaction\n\n\nIn the above example, there is a stronger association between the passage of time and number of words recalled for the Alzheimer’s diagnosis group compared to those without Alzheimer’s. For the Alzheimer’s diagnosis group, there is a strong negative association between the passage of time and number of words recalled. For those without Alzheimer’s, there is a weak negative association between the passage of time and number of words recalled. That is, the effect of the passage of time on number of words recalled depends on whether the person has Alzheimer’s. In terms of the number of words recalled, the passage of time matters more for those with Alzheimer’s compared to those without Alzheimer’s.\nQuestion: For whom does the passage of time lead to fewer words recalled?\nAnswer: those with Alzheimer’s"

    "section": "\n4.1 Schedule Study Time",
    "text": "4.1 Schedule Study Time\nDo not leave things for last minute. You will have a lot to study before you know it. Try to keep up with the material and ask questions if you have them.\nStudy for shorter but more frequent periods. One of the BEST things you can do to learn the course material is study for a shorter amount of time, on multiple days a week, and for every week of the semester. Research clearly indicates that this is a much more effective approach than cramming your studying into two or three longer study sessions right before the exam. In a nutshell, the research on studying tells us that humans best remember information when they practice recalling that information across numerous study sessions.\nFor instance, if you budget one hour to learn all the different types of reliability and validity, you will be more likely to remember them on test day if you study them for 15 minutes across four days rather than studying them for a single hour at one time. Thus, even though you’re not studying the information for any longer, spreading out the times that you study (i.e., revisiting the material again and again for briefer study sessions) is the best approach to successfully remembering the information on test day and beyond the course itself.\nWe recommend studying the course material for 4–5 hours per week across three 90-minute study sessions or across four-to-five 60-minute study sessions. We suggest scheduling these study sessions in your calendar to occur every week just like you would your classes. Here is an example of what your study session schedule might look like:\n\n\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n\n\n8:00–9:30\n\n11:30–1:00\n5:30–7:00\n\n\n\nNow that you have scheduled regular study sessions, what is the most effective way to design your study strategy within each session? Research indicates that the most effective study strategy spreads out testing yourself on different parts of the material within study sessions as well as between study sessions. For instance, if you want to remember the inclusion and exclusion criteria for mental disorders, you might test yourself on what you remember, check your answers, and then move on to study something else. Then, at the end of the same study session, you could test yourself again on inclusion and exclusion criteria and check your answers. You could also decide to test yourself on these criteria at the start of each study session for a week, until remembering the information becomes easy and you can recall it automatically. This helps your brain practice successful remembering. If something is difficult to remember, try struggling with it before you show yourself the answer. Memory works sort of like a muscle, so challenging your brain to remember something difficult can help you remember more successfully the next time.\nBelow, we’ve included an example week of how individual study sessions might be structured using the spaced-out approach during a week early in the semester, when you have had the first three lectures and have already spent some time studying the first two lectures. Keep in mind that the third lecture has more material than the first two lectures and is the most recently learned (so the least studied). Thus, it is allotted the most time. Imagine spending 15–20 minutes on each block within a session. Customize these study sessions to spend the most time on course material that feels the most challenging to you and less time on material that you feel more confident about. As you can see, the lectures repeat across days and within single study sessions, and the study approaches draw from a variety of the effective study techniques we described in more detail in discussion section (and below!).\n\n\nExample Study Schedule"

    "section": "\n4.2 Test Yourself",
    "text": "4.2 Test Yourself\nOne of the BEST ways to learn the course material and do well on the exams is to test yourself on key concepts, their distinctions, and their implications/applications, rather than just re-reading or re-writing your notes over and over again. There are three testing methods that we highly recommend this semester.\nFirst, use Quizlet to test your ability to provide definitions for key concepts. We have created Quizlet study sets for each lecture; for instructions how to access them, see here. Note that you can use Quizlet as a strategy for organizing your self-learning, too. We recommend that you use the “Flashcards”, “Test”, and “Match” study methods. “Match” evaluates your ability to recognize or identify the correct definition for each term. This is the easiest approach and is a good starting place. “Test” also evaluates your ability to recognize or identify the correct definition for a term but uses a variety of testing strategies. This study method is more challenging than “Match”. “Flashcards” evaluates your ability to recall the correct definition for each term. This study method is the most challenging.\nSecond, complete all study questions for each lecture and all practice exam questions for each exam, which you can find in the “Study Questions” and “Practice Exam Questions” folders, respectively, of the “Files” tab in ICON. The study questions and practice exam questions are a great tool that will help you check for understanding of concepts. There are multiple-choice questions, for which all correct answers are provided. And there are open-ended questions, for which sample correct responses are provided. The latter type of question is particularly challenging, because research clearly demonstrates that trying to put class-related material into your own words is one of the best ways to learn new material and figure out what is confusing to you.\nThird, ask yourself questions about the material you have studied, answer them, and THEN check to see if you are correct. For example, after reviewing the first lecture, you might close your materials, then ask yourself “What are the four main measurement strategies in scientific clinical psychology, and how are they defined?” or “What are some key characteristics of scientific clinical psychology?” or “What are some key challenges facing scientific clinical psychology?”\nIn a prior semester of the class, the students who received the highest grades tended to spend relatively more time using Study Questions to test themselves compared to using Quizlet or rereading their notes (see figure below).\n\n\nGrades by Study Method in Prior Semester"

    "text": "4.3 Put Material Into Your Own Words\nAnother one of the BEST ways to learn the course material and do well on the exams is to put the course material into your own words or try to explain the material to someone/something else (including your ceiling fan).\nClose your notes on a particular portion of the material and then ask yourself some of the following questions or explain them to someone/something else: “What are the main points, concepts, and findings, in my own words? What is important about key points, concepts and findings, in my own words? What might another example of a key concept be? How can key concepts be applied? How do key concepts differ from one another, in my own words?”\nSimilarly, after reading a research article for discussion section, turn the material face down and ask yourself some of the following questions: “What is important about this reading, in my own words? What about this paper is relevant to our course? What are the main findings? What are the strengths and limitations of the study??\nThese approaches—which move beyond memorizing concepts—will help you more deeply understand and learn to apply course material, which is critical to success in this course. These approaches also help you figure out what’s confusing you, so you’re in a better position to ask questions during/after class, over email, or in office hours."

In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes."

Thus, you will not be penalized for missing two sections, although you still will be responsible for the covered material on exams, etc., and I urge you strongly to attend all sections. This strategy is designed to facilitate my management of the excuses associated with an occasional missed section (i.e., no more than two during the semester). In other words, make sure you attend and participate in at least 11 of your discussion sections this semester!!\nIf you have to a section for an excusable reason (e.g., you are sick), let your TA know as soon as possible that you will have to miss class—preferably before class, and no later than 48 hours after class. It is up to our discretion what is considered an excused absence. If it is an excused absence, a TA will send you notes from the section you missed, and you will be able to submit the in-class writing assignment by emailing it to your TA—you will still need to submit the writing assignment within one week of the missed discussion section to get attendance credit for that section. If you miss a section, you can attend a different section during the same week only with the permission of the instructor of the different section, but you will not receive attendance and participation points for doing so (unless the absence is excused by the instructor).\nLecture attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged; most material presented in lecture is not included in the readings, and lecture recordings may not always be available. You are responsible for and will be tested on all material presented in lectures, discussion sections, and in the required readings.
