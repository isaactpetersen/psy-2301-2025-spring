# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

The Psychology department has a hierarchical course structure that requires students to complete certain prerequisites before taking upper-level classes.
The prerequisite for this course is Elementary Psychology (PSY:1001).

# Description of Course {#description}

This course is designed to introduce you to the concepts and methods of the science of clinical psychology.

It has three areas of emphasis:

1. Fundamentals of Scientific Clinical Psychology
1. Evidence-Based Psychological Assessment
1. Evidence-Based Psychological Intervention

This course will provide an introduction to (a) major theoretical models and research methods in scientific clinical psychology; (b) several psychological problems that are particularly relevant to college students (depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse); (c) the general principles underlying the construction, administration, and interpretation of evidence-based clinical assessments; and (d) empirically supported approaches to psychological intervention.
*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if you are reluctant to examine these topics in a scientific manner.*

Note: Some topics and movies will deal with sensitive or controversial issues such alcohol problems, depression, anxiety, abuse, sexual assault, eating disorders, and suicide.

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

Taking this course should make you a more informed consumer of claims about contemporary clinical psychology and may assist in your evaluation of clinical psychology or other related potential career goals.
This course is not designed to provide extensive information on the nature of psychological disorders (see Abnormal Psychology course) or to provide you with the skills to assess and treat psychological problems.

# Required Textbook {#textbook}

There isn't a required or recommended textbook.
Instead, this course will include a combination of book chapters, peer-reviewed journal articles, and popular media articles.
The source for all exam questions will be lecture, discussion, and all required readings for lectures and section, which will be provided on the course website on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
The cost of textbooks has become so high that I am not comfortable requiring one for this course when I can cover the material adequately in other ways.
There also is no textbook available that covers the material as we do in class.
Attendance at lectures will be critical as a result, however.
If you miss a lecture or section, you will need to watch the lecture recording or get notes from a peer, because we do not provide notes or re-present missed lecture or section material in meetings.
Once you have the notes from a peer, review them carefully on your own, then get into office hours with me or one of the TAs to address any specific questions that you have as soon as possible.
Feel free to come to office hours with me or with one of the TAs to discuss how best to study for a course without a textbook.

# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Academic misconduct must be reported by instructors to CLAS according to [these procedures](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Please note that collaboration with other classmates on quizzes and during exams is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates to *prepare* for exams (e.g., informal study groups).

# Course Requirements and Policies {#requirements}

## Lecture {#lecture}

We will meet twice weekly for lectures, at the time and location described [above](#lectureTime).
My powerpoint presentations for each lecture will be posted on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu) no later than noon the day before a lecture (though I may continue to refine the slides up until the time of lecture).
<u>Please note:</u> powerpoint presentations are an outline of my points. 
<u>It is your responsibility to take notes during class.</u>
I strongly recommend bringing the powerpoint presentations to class to take notes.

You should feel free to ask questions during lecture, although some questions may need to be deferred given the size of the class and the need to complete coverage of specific material during lecture.
<u>Questions and further discussion of class material are always welcome</u> during office hours, during discussion section, and via e-mail.
Please bear in mind that extensive or complex questions may not be addressable over e-mail.

### Lecture Recordings {#recordings}

My intention is to record lectures so that you may review them.
Recorded lectures will be posted on the "UICapture" tab in [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
Recordings will be available up to 48 hours after class (for Wednesday lectures) or until the Wednesday class period (for Monday lectures).
However, <u>please do not count on recordings being available</u>, in case I accidentally forget to initiate the recording or there is a technical malfunction.
The availability of lecture recordings will not be extended beyond 48 hours after lecture—the recordings are meant to help people keep up with lectures and for students to retrieve the relevant content if they missed anything during the live lecture or if they miss the lecture; they are not meant to be a study method that allows people to fall behind in class from week to week.
If you miss something and are unable to watch the lecture recording, you can get/review notes with a peer, and then come to office hours if you have specific questions.

## Discussion Section {#discussionSection}

In addition to lecture, you also have a weekly discussion section, except during exam weeks.
The day and time of the weekly discussion section differs based on the section, see [above](#sections).

## Attendance and Participation {#attendanceParticipation}

Discussion section attendance and participation are mandatory and will be worth 8% of your final grade.
You must attend section, pay attention, participate verbally, <u>and</u> complete the required activities during section to receive any attendance and participation points, as indicated by your <u>submission of the required written responses during section at the end of the section session</u>.
There will be 13 discussions during the semester, and you will receive one point for submitting an appropriate written response at the end of each section, up to a <u>maximum</u> of 11 points (i.e., you will not receive extra credit for submitting appropriate responses for all 13 discussions).
Thus, you will not be penalized for missing two sections, although you still will be responsible for the covered material on exams, etc., and I urge you strongly to attend all sections.
This strategy is designed to facilitate my management of the excuses associated with an occasional missed section (i.e., no more than two during the semester).
In other words, make sure you attend and participate in at least 11 of your discussion sections this semester!!

If you have to a section for an excusable reason (e.g., you are sick), let your TA know as soon as possible that you will have to miss class—preferably before class, and no later than 48 hours after class.
It is up to our discretion what is considered an excused absence.
If it is an excused absence, a TA will send you notes from the section you missed, and you will be able to submit the in-class writing assignment by emailing it to your TA—<u>you will still need to submit the writing assignment within one week of the missed discussion section to get attendence credit for that section</u>.
If you miss a section, you can attend a different section during the same week <u>only with the permission of the instructor of the different section</u>, <u>but you will not receive attendance and participation points for doing so</u> (unless the absence is excused by the instructor).

Lecture attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly encouraged; most material presented in lecture is not included in the readings, and lecture recordings may not always be available.
<u>You are responsible for and will be tested on all material presented in lectures, discussion sections, and in the required readings</u>.
Regular attendance and good attention to lectures will improve what you get out of this class and is likely to improve your performance on the exams.

## Readings & Quizzes {#readingQuizzes}

Readings and other materials will be posted on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
You are expected to do the readings before discussion section.
You will have an online quiz on the readings to complete in [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu), on your own, <u>before</u> each discussion section.
The quizzes are meant to help you come to class prepared to contribute so you are best-positioned to learn and to help others learn.
The quizzes are not timed (you can spend as much time as you need on each quiz up until the deadline).
The deadline for each quiz is 30 minutes before your scheduled discussion section starts.
We will not accept late responses or multiple submissions.
Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
We will not accept excused absences for quizzes because (a) you have a week to complete the quiz (and can submit it at any point during that week), and (b) we drop your lowest quiz score.
Each quiz will be weighted the same in the final grade.
Quiz answers will be viewable at the end of the week (i.e., after the last discussion section has taken their quiz).

Past experience has shown that in order to do well in this class, you should read the required material, participate actively in class, and go over your notes <u>each week</u>.
There is too much material being covered in this class to try to study only by frantic preparation immediately before exams.
Note that lecture and section will <u>not</u> cover all relevant material for the course; you will be expected to know the <u>required</u> readings for exams.

## Workload {#workload}

This is a 3 semester hour course.
Students should therefore expect to spend [6 additional hours per week](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-workload-guidelines) (outside of class) reading the articles, reviewing material from lecture and discussion section, and preparing for quizzes and exams.

## Examinations {#exams}

There will be 3 exams.
The exams will include multiple-choice questions.
Each exam will emphasize information presented for the third of the class that precedes it.
However, some integration of information across sections will be required for questions on the second and third exams.
Exam questions can come from <u>any of the following sources: lectures, sections, or required readings</u>.
For suggested study tips for this class, see [here](howToStudy.html).

### Missing Exams {#missingExams}

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.
In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa [Absence Explanation Form](https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/student-attendance-and-absences) and must be approved by Professor Petersen.
<u>In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen or the TA must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen or the TA</u>.

# Grading {#grading}

Final grades will be assigned at the end of semester on the basis of your total percentage of points earned on exams, quizzes, and section participation, as detailed below.
Grades will be assigned on an absolute scale (criterion-referenced grading); course grades will not be curved.
No extra-credit opportunities are available for this course.
Please note: As a matter of fairness to all students, I assign grades based on performance and do not negotiate grades.
Final grades will be assigned based on the following ranges:

| Grade | Percent |
|:------|:--------|
| A+    | 97–100% | 
| A     | 93–96   |
| A-    | 90–92   |
| B+    | 87–89   |
| B     | 83–86   |
| B-    | 80–82   |
| C+    | 75–79   |
| C     | 70–74   |
| C-    | 65–69   |
| D+    | 60–64   |
| D     | 55–59   |
| D-    | 50–54   |
| F     | < 50%   |

I round up from .5 when determining final grades.
For example, a course percent of 79.50 would receive a B-, whereas a course percent of 79.49 would receive a C+.

The relative contribution of each component to your final grade is as follows:

 - 28%	Examination #1
 - 28%	Examination #2
 - 28%	Examination #3 (administered only during the class's Final Exam time slot)
 - 8% 	Discussion Attendance/Participation
 - 8% 	Reading Quizzes

# Tentative Course Outline (exam dates fixed) {#outline}

## Section Notes {#sectionNotes}

- Sections will not be held during the week of examinations.
